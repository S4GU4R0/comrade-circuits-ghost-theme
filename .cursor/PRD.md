# Product Requirements Document: CC Site

## 1. Start with the “Why” — Problem Statement
Before you talk features, explain why this product or feature even exists. This keeps the team focused on solving the right problem, not just building for the sake of it.

Prospective members do not currently know this exists and cannot sign up. This feature will give them a place to see it and get involved.

## 2. Define the Goals — What Success Looks Like
Goals should be measurable so you can say “yes, we nailed it” or “no, we missed it”.
Write down clear objectives:

* Have a landing page
* Have a way for members to sign up
* Have the newsletter functionality working
* Launch within 1 week


## 3. Describe the Solution — High-Level Features
List the key features without getting lost in technical details yet.
* Landing page
* User auth
* Subscription sign up and cancelation

## 4. User Stories — Write from the User’s View
These help devs, designers, and testers stay human-focused.
“As a friend of S4GU4R0, I want to check out the benefits of his collective and possibly sign up”
"As a collective member, I want to log in and see which apps I have access to."
"As an interested party, I want to become a member."
"As a broke member, I want to cancel my membership."

## 5. Technical Notes & Constraints
Here’s where you bring in reality checks:

* must use ˝Ghost/handlebars
* must be mobile first
* must use Tailwind and DaisyUI (because I am dogmatic and at least know how to use these)

## 6. Timeline & Milestones
Break the project into chunks:

* Day 1–4: Development
* Day 5: Testing
* Day 6: Launch

## 7. Acceptance Criteria
How do you know the feature is done and ready?
* No critical bugs on mobile
* Styles work as expected
* All pages are present
* All the t's are crossed and i's are dotted.
